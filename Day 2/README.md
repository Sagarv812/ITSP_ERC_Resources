# Resources for Simulation

Find below some great resources for simulating whatever you'll need whether it be in **üí°Circuitry, ü§ñRobotics, ü¶æMechanics or even üíªCoding**.

## ü§ñ Robotic Simulation

- [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/) - Iterate quickly on design concepts and control strategies with Gazebo's rich suite of tools, libraries, and cloud services. Used mostly for **Physics** and **ROS** simulation.  
  Available primarily for **Linux** and **macOS** with experimental support for Windows.

- [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) - Webots is an open source and multi-platform desktop application used to simulate robots. It provides a complete development environment to model, program and simulate robots. Used mostly for **3d Simulation**.  
  Available for **Windows**, **Linux** and **macOS**.

- [CoppeliaSim](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) - CoppeliaSim provides a distributed control architecture where each object in a simulation can be individually controlled through **Embedded Scripts**, **Plugins**, or **External APIs**.  
  Available for **Windows**, **macOS** and **Ubuntu**.

- [MORSE](https://www.openrobots.org/morse/doc/stable/morse.html) - MORSE is a generic simulator for academic robotics. It focuses on realistic 3D simulation of small to large environments, indoor or outdoor, with one to tens of autonomous robots. MORSE can be entirely controlled from the command-line. Simulation scenes are generated from simple **Python scripts**.  
  Available mainly for **Linux** but also has limited support for **Windows**.

- [AirSim](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/) - AirSim is a simulator for drones, cars and more, built on **Unreal Engine**.  
  Available for **Windows**, **Linux** and **macOS**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Mechatronics & System Simulation

- [MATLAB Simulink](https://in.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html) - MATLAB Simulink is a graphical programming environment for modeling, simulating, and analyzing multidomain dynamic systems using block diagrams.  
  Available via **student license**.  
  Available for **Windows**, **Linux** and **macOS**.

- [Scilab + Xcos](https://www.scilab.org/) - Scilab is a free, open-source software and high-level programming language for numerical computation, data analysis, and dynamic system modeling and simulation with its Xcos environment.  
  Alternative for MATLAB Simulink.  
  Available for **Windows**, **Linux** and **macOS**.

- [OpenModelica](https://openmodelica.org/) - Modelica allows you to describe physical components (e.g., a resistor, a spring, a pump) using fundamental physical laws (equations) without explicitly defining inputs and outputs in advance. This is the primary difference between this and Simulink or Scilab.   
  **Simulink - causal** , whereas, **OpenModelica - acausal**  
  Available for **Windows**, **Linux** and **macOS**.


- [SimScale](https://www.simscale.com/) - A cloud based service which offers robust support for **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)** and **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**.

## ‚ö° Circuit & Electronics Simulation

- [LTspice](https://www.analog.com/en/resources/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) - LTspice¬Æ is a powerful, fast, and free SPICE simulator software, schematic capture and waveform viewer with enhancements and models for improving the simulation of analog circuits.  
  Available for **Windows** and **MacOS** only.

- [Falstad](https://falstad.com/circuit/) - Electronic circuit simulator which visually animates current flow and voltage changes in circuit.

- [QUCS](https://qucs.sourceforge.net/) - QUCS is particularly useful if your work primarily involves RF, microwave, or highly specialized high-frequency circuit design.  
  Available for **Windows**, **Linux** and **macOS**.

- [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/) - EasyEDA is a free, web-based electronic design automation (EDA) tool that provides an integrated suite for schematic capture, SPICE circuit simulation (based on Ngspice), and PCB layout, often with direct integration for component ordering and PCB manufacturing services. It's easy to collaborate in real time with its cloud sharing capabilities.

## üß† Embedded & Microcontroller Simulation

- [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) - Great microcontroller simulation for Arduino/ESP32. Provides a nice graphical interface but with limited sensors and actuators in the free version. It is web based or there is a VSCode version.

- [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits) - Similar to Wokwi. Very beginner friendly - uses blocks and code if needed. Not recommended for advanced projects. Also web based.

- [SimulIde](https://simulide.com/p/) - Intermediate microcontroller and circuit simulation with more features than the above two options.  
  Available for **Windows**, **Linux** and **macOS**.

- [Proteus VSM](https://www.labcenter.com/) - Advanced microcontroller and circuit simulation with a lot more customizability which comes with difficulty of use. Recommended for advanced projects.
  Available mainly on **Windows** only.
